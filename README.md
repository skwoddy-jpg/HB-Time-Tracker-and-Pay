📖 How to Sync Across Devices
1. Link Your Device
Open the app on your primary device, tap the Account Icon (User silhouette), and enter an email and password to "Link Account." This secures your existing local data to the cloud.
2. Connect Other Instances
On your laptop or second phone, open the app, go to the Account menu, and select "Sign In Instead." Once logged in, your devices will act as identical mirrors of each other.
3. Real-Time Operation
If you "Clock In" on your phone, you can "Clock Out" or "Pause" from your laptop. The cloud acts as the single source of truth.
